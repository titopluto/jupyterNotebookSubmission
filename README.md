# jupyterNotebookSubmission
This Repository was created for students to test how to answer questions on an ipython notebook. Clone, commit and push the changes back to the remote repository.

- Clone this repository on your local computer
- Using your local Jupyter installation or Google Colab, practice answering questions, making commits and pushing back to your remote repository
- Try to feel comfortable with this workflow as I explained in class and make as many commits as possible to get used to the process
